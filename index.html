        Game rules
        </h2>
        <p class="box_text">
        Flappy Owl's rules are relativley simple. FIrst of all the commands, to make your Owl fly higher, click the up arrow or W key, whatever you prefer. But remember that your owl will be constantly falling so make sure he stays in the air. If the game is too easy click H to activate hard mode. This will add a moving obstacle to make the game harder. Be carefull because if yo hit an obstacle you will lose and your owl will die. Be carefull and GOOD LUCK!

            About us <br>
            In this project I have learned a lot. The easiest part was CSS as I felt very comfortable and it came easily. Then the HTML was harder but still I could go back to code illusions and find the anwsers. The hardest part was definetley the java. I had not learned everything about sprites and that was very difficult. What made it a lot easier was p5 play and it helped a lot. It really made me expand my knowledge of coding and im very glad that I learned all these new things.
